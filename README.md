# Analysis for reverse engineering cell competition using multimodal microscopy and deep learning analysis

This repository features various analysis scripts from my PhD project studying cell competition.
Cell competition is broadly defined as a quality control mechanism that results in less-fit “loser” cells being eliminated from a biological tissue. This mechanism impacts a wide variety of different physiological and pathological scenarios, from senescence to tumorigenesis to tissue development.
I track the behaviours of cells using fluorescent markers and quantitative label-free methodology throughout their lifetime before they commit to a certain fate, be it mitosis, apoptosis or senescence. By building a detailed picture of the event chronology of an individual cell’s cycle I hope to understand what factors play influential roles in triggering cellular decisions. Do the “winner” cells that I am studying commit to division in order to crowd out the “loser” cells, or do they simply fill the void left by a “loser” cell that has chosen to apoptose? Is the cellular decision making active or passive? 
I am using H2B tagged fluorescent proteins, FUCCI markers and quantitative phase microscopy to study internal cellular dynamics over many generations. Bayesian tracking then maps the path the cell takes throughout its lifetime. Studying heterogeneous monolayers of epithelial cells, this approach yields data that allows for an investigation into the behaviour of a tissue to a high level of temporal and spatial resolution; all the cells imaged are followed and annotated at every timestep throughout their entire lifetime.
